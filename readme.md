# Quotes-API

## Link

I deployed the app on Heroku. You can [check it out here](https://becode-quotes-api-exercise.herokuapp.com/).

## About this project

For this project I worked with Node.js.
I used the following packages:

- body-parser
- cors
- dotenv
- ejs
- express
- mongoose

You can get random quotes that are saved in the database pushing the Get A Quote-button.
If you want to see your own quote, fill in the form and push the POST-button.

It wil reload the page so all the quotes are fetched again. Yours will be included now.

If you don't like a quote you can press the delete button. It will then be deleted from the database. It will also reload the page to fetch the remaining quotes.

## Install

    $ git clone https://github.com/stefanreusens/Quotes-API
    $ cd Quotes-API/
    $ npm install
    $ node index.js
